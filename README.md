# blockworld
 blockworld is a game similar to minecraft, but is different. i will work on it every now and then, but i wont work on it very much. i might change something with terrain or textures, but yeah. thats it

# run in intellij idea
just go to command prompt and `cd` in the blockworld dirctory, and type `gradlew run` to run

# info

the terrain is not always random. it will be a saved level inside the `run` folder.
to get new terrain. you can either delete it, or delete like 1 character, itll (somehow) corrupted, and youll get a new one
